# PureScript Super Circle :tornado:

A simplified Super Hexagon clone written in PureScript. There are only two controls: the **left** and **right** arrow keys.

The code is one (fully documented) file in `src/Main.purs`; feel free to [send me a tweet](https://twitter.com/am_i_tom) if you have any questions!

This was written for the [JSOxford "Transpile All the Things"](https://jsoxford.com/2018-05-16-transpile-all-the-things/) meetup.

# Installation

Assuming you have a recent enough version of Node to have the `npx` command:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/i-am-tom/purescript-super-circles.git
$ cd purescript-super-circles
$ npm i
$ npx bower i
$ npm run build
$ python -m http.server -- Or whatever static server you prefer!
```

Navigate to `localhost:8000` in your browser, and away you go!
